The error occurs because the `alpine` Docker image is minimal and doesn't include OpenSSL by default—it's not in the `$PATH` inside the container. This is a common issue with lightweight images like Alpine. Here's the quickest fix: modify the verification command in Step 5 to temporarily install OpenSSL inside the container using Alpine's package manager (`apk`). No need to rebuild anything or change your setup.

### Updated Step 5: Verify and Restart
Run this revised command to check the expiry (it should still show ~Nov 22, 2025):
```
docker run --rm -v blackduck_hub_cert-volume:/certs alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache openssl && openssl x509 -in /certs/server.pem -text -noout | grep 'Not After'"
```

- The `--no-cache` flag keeps the container lightweight by avoiding package cache storage.
- If you prefer a pre-installed image (no install step), swap `alpine` for `ubuntu` (which has OpenSSL built-in):
  ```
  docker run --rm -v blackduck_hub_cert-volume:/certs ubuntu openssl x509 -in /certs/server.pem -text -noout | grep "Not After"
  ```

The rest of the restart process remains the same:
```
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml blackduck
```

Monitor logs as before: `docker service logs blackduck_nginx`. If the cert loads successfully, you should see the expiration alert in the UI (bell icon > Notifications) or API (`/api/notifications?filter=type%3DCERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION`) right away, since it's under the 30-day threshold.

If you run into any other issues (e.g., cert validation errors in logs), share the exact error output for more targeted troubleshooting!
